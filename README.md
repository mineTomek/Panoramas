# Panoramas Mod
My own version of many other mods that allow you to change the title screen panorama.

It's very simple to use. Just press the `H` key (this can be changed) in your world and your title screen will become what you see right now.

For best results look in all directions and load the world around you, because the panorama is grabbed so fast, that parts of the world might be missing.

### Setting the panorama:

If you want to change your panorama just go into the world select menu where you will see 2 new buttons.

The first one is only enabled when the selected world has a created panorama. When you press it the panorama of this world is loaded as the title panorama.

The second button reverts the panorama to the default one from Minecraft.

### Configuration:

There are 3 configuration options:
- `Resolution` dictates what size would the panorama be. Its calculated from window height times this multiplier
- `Hide panoramas resourcepacks` determines whether the panoramas resourcepacks should be displayed or not
- `Automatically set new panoramas` is used to automatically load the panorama you just created as the current panorama
